An attempt to implement all tutorials from [LearnOpenGL.com](https://learnopengl.com/) for Android with OpenGL ES 3.0 using Kotlin only.

## Scene controls

* It is possible to move around in the scene from chapter *Getting started: Camera* onward
* Tap and move to look around
* Pinch / unpinch to move forward / backward
